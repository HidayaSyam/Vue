### Notes : 
- data is a function return objecte 
- v-bind and the Interpolation {{}}  they are the two way to outputing the data 
- in Interpolation you can excuate Javscript code 1+1 ,Math.Random .... 
-in Interpolation you can call a method by adding the methodname with ()
- methods it's allowed to you to defined functions that excuet when smth happend 
- methods it's a object that hold functions
- the data for exmple may content some Html tags or structer so we have to use v-html and we can pass the varible from data or method
