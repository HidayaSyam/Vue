# Vue

### Notes : 
- data is a function return object 
- v-bind and the Interpolation {{}}  they are the two way to outputting the data 
- in Interpolation, you can execute Javascript code 1+1 ,Math.Random .... 
- in Interpolation, you can call a method by adding the method name with ()
- methods it's allowed to you to define functions that execute when smth happened 
- methods it's an object that holds functions
- the data for example may content some Html tags or structure so we have to use v-html and we can pass the variable from data or method
